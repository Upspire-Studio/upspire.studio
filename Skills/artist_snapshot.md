# Shawn Kemp: Artist Practice & Process Snapshot

## Core Identity

A generative artist who bridges computational systems and physical craft. Creates one-of-a-kind dimensional wall sculptures by translating algorithmic outputs into hand-assembled, laser-cut layered artworks. Based in Bellingham, Washington.

**Primary thesis:** Code becomes form. Abstract math transforms into objects that live in homes, catch light, spark conversation, change with perspective.

## Art Practice Overview

### What You Make

**Format:** One-of-a-kind, custom-generated generative artworks fabricated as dimensional layered relief sculptures.

**Medium:** Laser-cut acid-free mat-board (formerly plywood with shellac finish in earlier work) stacked and bound using PVA (polyvinyl acetate), an archival-quality glue from bookbinding traditions.

**Dimensions:** Typically 16x20 inches to 24x30 inches, sculptural depth from 0.5 to 1+ inches depending on layer count.

**Aesthetic:** Patterns rooted in nature (mandalas, fractals, organic geometry) and mathematics. Strong emphasis on layering, shadow play, dimensional contrast. Clean, precise cuts. Works change appearance based on light source, viewing angle, and spatial context.

**Positioning:** Described as "visual poems"—not meant to be solved or decoded, but contemplated over time.

## Creative Process: The System

### Phase 1: Code & Intuition

You work with open-platform generative code (historically via fxhash for NFTs, now custom scripts). The system has two components:

* **Seed:** Defines which elements can be generated (pattern families, shapes, color palettes, geometry rules).
* **Random element:** Sets parameter boundaries for how far those elements can vary—controls the expression space of the algorithm.

The process is non-deterministic by design: the same seed + algorithm produces billions of possible outputs.

### Phase 2: The Singular Conversation (Current Model)

For your latest work series, *Singulars*, the process is deliberately slow and personal:

1. **Curiosity Waitlist:** Collectors signal interest with zero obligation.

2. **Invitation & Dialogue:** When bandwidth permits, you invite waitlist members to share something about themselves—a note, story, fragment, color preference, memory, dream, music, or emotion they're drawn to.

3. **Parameter Intuition:** You read their submission and intuitively adjust code parameters. This is non-rational; you describe it as "feeling around in the dark for the shape of something."

4. **Generation & Recognition:** You generate dozens of outputs, waiting for a moment of alignment—when the algorithm, the person's story, and the visual form click into resonance. You just know when it's right.

5. **Digital Preview:** The successful output is sent to the collector as a digital file.

6. **Tiered Pricing Ritual:**
   * $275 (24 hours exclusive to the collector who catalyzed the piece)
   * $550 (24 hours, open to other curiosity members if first pass)
   * $1,200 (public offering if uncollected after 48 hours)

This creates a natural rhythm and lifecycle—first private, then shared, then released.

### Phase 3: Physical Fabrication

Once a piece is collected:

1. **File Preparation:** The digital output is decomposed into a stack of precisely aligned vector layers. Each layer = one plane in the final 3D composition.

2. **Laser Cutting:** Files are sent to your 100W CO₂ laser cutter, which slices through acid-free mat-board with extreme precision. Cuts are delicate, barely a hair's width.

3. **Hand Assembly:** Layers are stacked one by one. PVA (archival bookbinding glue) is applied with care—too much warps the board, too little fails to hold. This is meditative, refined through years of practice.

4. **Result:** A sculptural object with dimensional depth, shadow play, and light-responsive qualities.

**Timeline:** Slow, hands-on, deliberate. No batch production.

## Philosophy & Motivation

### Core Beliefs

* **Precision + Imperfection:** You honor both mathematical order and human touch. The algorithm is precise; the assembly is tactile and vulnerable.

* **Abstraction as Personal:** Something born in pure math can feel deeply personal when rooted in someone's story or intuition.

* **Physical as Sacred:** Art on screens is infinite. Physical art is rare, singular, worth sitting with. It lives in homes, not in browsers.

* **Conversation Starter:** The best outcome is when someone asks, "What is that? How was it made?" The piece becomes a bridge between code, craft, nature, and the human.

* **Collaboration Through Catalysis:** Collectors aren't passive buyers but catalysts. They bring the piece into being through their story and presence.

### Recent Shift (Last ~12 Months)

Moved from batch production (limited editions, multiple outputs) to strictly one-to-one work. This reflects a desire to go deeper, slow down, and bring more intentionality to each piece. The *Singulars* project embodies this philosophy.

## Current Production Capacity & Model

**Availability:** Works one-to-one, so capacity is intentionally limited. A few pieces per month depending on bandwidth.

**Audience:** Mid-to-high ticket collectors, tech-forward patrons (founders, product leaders, engineers, design-minded executives), people drawn to the intersection of art + code + craft.

**Sales Channels:**
* Direct through shawnkemp.art (Substack + studio site)
* Saatchi Art (gallery representation)
* Etsy (some digital products and limited physical pieces)
* Instagram (@shawnkemp_art)
* Historical: fxhash (NFT platform; still maintained as digital archive)

**Price Range:** $275–$1,200+ for physical *Singulars*; custom commissions likely higher.

## Technical & Material Specifications

### Hardware

* **Laser Cutter:** 100W CO₂ laser (precise enough to cut mat-board with hair's-width accuracy)
* **Materials:** Acid-free mat-board, PVA (archival glue), optional: shellac tint (historical process)
* **Software:** Custom generative scripts (historical: fxhash, p5.js, or similar frameworks)

### Design Principles

* **Vector-Based:** Designs are generated as vector layers, not raster, enabling precise laser cutting at any scale.
* **Modular Layering:** Each output is decomposable into 8–20+ individual layers, each representing a distinct visual plane.
* **Parameter Space:** Code is written so that small intuitive tweaks (color saturation, pattern density, rotation, scale) create large visual shifts.

### Archival Quality

* Acid-free materials used throughout
* PVA adhesive chosen for permanence (traditional bookbinding standard)
* Designed to age gracefully and be durable for decades

## Key Differentiators

1. **Code → Craft Pipeline:** Few artists consistently produce both generative digital outputs AND high-quality physical objects from those outputs. This dual mastery is rare.

2. **Intentional One-to-One Model:** In a world of limited editions and batch drops, working with one collector at a time creates scarcity and depth.

3. **Narrative Integration:** The collector's story becomes part of the generative process, not added as marketing copy afterward.

4. **Dimensional/Sculptural Approach:** Unlike prints or flat work, these are relief sculptures that reward spatial interaction, light play, and extended looking.

5. **Precision + Handcraft Balance:** The work refuses to choose between algorithmic precision and human touch; it insists on both.

## AI Agent Skills & Knowledge Areas

An AI agent working with this practice should understand and be able to reference:

1. **Generative Art Systems:** Seeds, randomness, parameter spaces, fxhash, p5.js, vector generation, determinism vs. emergence.

2. **Physical Fabrication:** Laser cutting, mat-board properties, PVA adhesives, layering/assembly, dimensional design, light interaction.

3. **Collector Psychology:** Why someone buys one-of-one work, what "singular" means in art market terms, how narrative + scarcity drive value.

4. **Business/Positioning:** CPO and strategist background; ability to translate technical work for collectors who are CEOs, founders, engineers; understanding of community + narrative as moat.

5. **Philosophical Framework:** The artist's bridge between precision and imperfection, abstraction and personhood, code and craft, speed and intentionality.

6. **Historical Context:** Your background in web/gaming/NFTs and how that informs current work; ability to speak credibly to both tech audiences and traditional collectors.

7. **Community & Narrative:** Capacity to engage with collectors on the level of story, meaning, and long-term relationship, not just transaction.
