# Shawn Kemp: Biography, History & Backstory

## Quick Identity

Shawn Kemp is a fourth-generation entrepreneur, industrial designer, and generative artist who has spent the last two decades at the intersection of technology, ethics, and creative systems. His career is characterized by a repeating pattern: discovering exciting new platforms/tools, building significant communities and value, then wrestling with ethical implications until deciding to step back and pursue work more aligned with his values. Currently, he is channeling this pattern into generative art as a medium for bringing joy and intention back into his creative practice.

**Core descriptor (from LinkedIn):** "Insatiably curious."

## Early Life & Formation (1970s-1990s)

### Hawaii Origins

Shawn was raised in Kona, Hawaii, in an environment that fostered early technical curiosity and maker culture. In high school during the early 1990s, he participated in a state-sponsored program where high schools designed and raced solar vehicles in a Department of Energy competition. This was not a casual project: he and his teammates engineered the first solar vehicle to successfully drive from California to Delaware. For a group of high schoolers, this was a significant technical achievement that required systems thinking, teamwork, problem-solving under constraints, and a comfort with bleeding-edge technology.

**Mentorship:** During this solar car program, Shawn met Budd Steinhilber, one of the founders of the Industrial Designers Society of America. Steinhilber saw potential and intentionality in Shawn's work and actively encouraged him to pursue formal industrial design education. This single mentorship moment redirected Shawn's trajectory.

**Key Theme:** Early evidence of pioneer mentality, comfort with uncertain/frontier technology, and receptivity to wise mentorship.

### Western Washington University (1994-1998)

Following Steinhilber's guidance, Shawn moved to Bellingham, Washington, to study industrial design at Western Washington University (BS, 1998). This move away from Hawaii to a small Pacific Northwest college town would become his geographic anchor for the next 25+ years. The industrial design degree gave him formal training in systems thinking, materiality, process, form, and human-centered design. This foundation would shape his later approach to product design at Microsoft and eventually inform his generative art practice (understanding how systems generate form, how digital becomes physical).

**Key Theme:** Following mentorship rather than predetermined path; geographic commitment to community.

## Early Tech Career (1998-2006): Building Communities

### Beta Think: First Startup (1999-2000)

After graduating, Shawn moved to Seattle (staying in Washington state, within driving distance of Bellingham). He bought a house, split the mortgage with roommates, and started his own consulting company, Beta Think. The focus was cutting-edge web design: Adobe Flash and interactive advertising. At the time (late 1990s), most web graphics were static. Flash represented the frontier of interactivity. His clients ranged from casinos to agencies eager to experiment with animated, interactive banner ads.

**Note:** This establishes a pattern: Shawn is drawn to frontier/emerging tech, sees its potential, and builds expertise early.

### Microsoft & Xbox (2000-2006): Succeeding at Scale

By chance, Shawn attended a temp agency with a friend and ran into a Western Washington University alumnus who asked if he was interested in a project called "codename Xbox." This led to a six-year tenure at Microsoft spanning two major roles:

**Creative Director, Xbox (2000-2003, 3 years)**

Shawn led the user experience, interface design, and production art for Xbox.com, Shop.Microsoft.com, and Microsoft.com/insider. He managed a cross-functional team of roughly 20 people spanning site management, editorial, design, and production. Key achievements:

- Drove global site identity and strategy for Xbox.com across three full site redesigns, making them scalable for all regional partners
- Contributed to the original Xbox brand guidelines and visual identity at product launch
- Managed external vendor relationships and in-house design/production budget of $500K
- Built a "robust and active community" around the Xbox gaming console

This was a success story: he was good at the work, comfortable with corporate structures, capable of leading teams, and able to translate product strategy into user experience.

**Audience & Portfolio Planner, then Group Manager (2004-2006, 2+ years)**

Shawn transitioned into broader corporate strategy roles, managing portfolios of web properties (Windows Vista, XP, Internet Explorer, Dynamics, Enterprise Marketing). He drove web-related planning for the Vista launch and helped define preferred agencies for Microsoft's outsourced online marketing.

**Why He Left:**

Despite professional success, Shawn began to question the ramifications of his work. He later reflected: "I've always had that awareness of, is it moving in a positive direction or is it moving in a detrimental direction." At Xbox, he became aware of industry practices designed to increase gaming in the target demographic without regard for negative effects. He worried about his legacy and the impact of the products he was building.

Compounding this were work conditions: 80-hour weeks, a "extremely misogynistic male-dominated culture that just chewed through people." Shawn was physically and mentally burned out.

**Key Pattern Emerging:** Success + Impact Questions + Exhaustion = Departure to reflect.

He left Microsoft around 2006 and took time off with his wife. They moved back to Bellingham to think about next steps.

## Nonprofit & Startup Era (2006-2021): Purpose Seeking

### Transition: ONE/Northwest (2008-2009)

After reflecting, Shawn worked as a strategist at ONE/Northwest, a Seattle-based nonprofit helping nonprofits integrate technology into their operations. He built websites, databases, and email systems designed to increase efficiency and online presence for mission-driven organizations. He enjoyed the work (mission alignment was present) but eventually felt that a for-profit model might have more leverage and sustainability.

**Mentorship Role:** He was part of the team transformation that eventually became Groundwire, a leader in nonprofit technology and strategy.

### Parallel Ventures (2008-2014)

While doing nonprofit work, Shawn also:

**ShareZen (2010-2014):** Founded a SaaS platform designed to reduce friction in sharing assets among multiple parties. Partners included Sporty's Pilot Shop and others; the platform served thousands of planes, homes, and boats. Acquired by a private party in 2014. This was a successful, profitable business.

**Invent Coworking & Startup Hub (2010-2014):** Founded "The BIG Idea Lab," a physical coworking space and startup accelerator in Bellingham. The mission was to create a network of resources, advisors, and like-minded entrepreneurs to turn "lean, fast, profitable" ideas into successful businesses. This reflects his commitment to local community building and supporting next-generation entrepreneurs.

**Board Roles:** During this period, Shawn also served on boards including Road-iQ (formerly Qualnetics; helped facilitate its acquisition by Velvac), TAGNW (tech alliance for Northwest Washington), and The Playful World (Fair Trade toys). This shows his willingness to mentor and advise other ventures.

**Key Pattern:** Exploring multiple ventures simultaneously, grounding himself in community, advisory/board roles rather than pure execution.

### ActionSprout: The 9-Year Mission (2012-2021)

In March 2012, Shawn co-founded ActionSprout with Drew Bernard and George DeCarlo. The company's mission was to empower nonprofits and political campaigns to use Facebook effectively. At the time, Facebook represented a frontier for nonprofits: it was powerful but mysterious. Most organizations didn't know how to leverage it.

ActionSprout solved this with two components: a set of social action tools (27+ different action types, from signing petitions to donating to signing letters) and strategic consulting. Users could integrate custom actions directly into their Facebook pages, turning "likers" into engaged supporters.

**The Success:**

- 150,000+ clients in 70+ countries
- Bootstrapped for first 2 years; 2015 angel round from Oregon Angel Fund, Bellingham Angel Fund, Portland Seed Fund
- Co-founder Drew Bernard was CEO; Shawn played a strategic/product role
- Offices in Bellingham and Portland
- Philosophy: Bootstrap mindfully, don't raise aggressive VC, serve the mission

This was Shawn's longest and most impactful venture: a 9-year commitment to an ethical, profitable business serving nonprofits. He had found product-market fit and mission alignment. But ethical concerns emerged.

**The Unraveling (2018-2021):**

As ActionSprout scaled, Shawn began to see the dual nature of Facebook as a tool. The Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018) crystallized his concerns: the platform that could help nonprofits coordinate donors could also be weaponized to divide voters. More fundamentally, he came to believe: "We are more divided as a country directly because of social media. The ability to weaponize that tool and the inability for those platforms to counter that weaponization, whether they want to or not, is really hard."

He left ActionSprout in May 2021, describing himself as "physically exhausted, mentally exhausted, and ethically exhausted."

**The Pattern Completes Again:** Builds something successful, questions its impact, leaves when ethics become unbearable.

**Key Insight:** Shawn is not a burn-it-down cynic. He's someone with a persistent conscience. He stays in ventures for years, works hard to make them succeed, but cannot ignore ethical implications. When forced to choose between success and values, he chooses values. This is both his strength (integrity) and his limitation (difficulty remaining in large-scale systems).

## Transition to Art & Regenerative Work (2020-Present)

### Generative Art Genesis (November 2020)

During the pandemic and while still building ActionSprout, Shawn began exploring generative art as a creative outlet. He started creating generative NFTs on the fxhash platform using algorithmic code to generate unique visual outputs. Unlike static art, generative art uses seed values and randomness to produce infinite variations from a single script.

**The Appeal:** After years in mission-driven but complex tech, generative art represented a return to pure creativity, systems thinking, and craftsmanship. Code could generate form. Algorithmic systems could be beautiful without requiring 150,000 clients or geopolitical implications.

**Key Statement (from Upspire Art Substack):** "After nine years leading a technology company I am finally taking some time to really dive into my practice of creating laser cut works."

### Translating Digital to Physical (2020-2021)

Rather than leaving generative art as purely digital NFTs, Shawn took the additional step of fabricating physical artworks from digital outputs. Using a 100W CO2 laser cutter, he sliced through precision mat-board, creating dimensional layered relief sculptures. Each digital generative output was decomposed into a stack of vector layers, then hand-assembled with archival PVA glue.

This bridged his interests: code-generated form + industrial design knowledge + craft + intentionality. The work was singular, handmade, and materially present.

### Funcert Experiment (Nov 2021-June 2022)

Shawn briefly took a CPO role at Funcert, a platform allowing musicians to upload and sell live performances as collectable NFTs. He architected, designed, and built the platform. After 8 months, he stepped back. The brief tenure suggests the entrepreneurial itch was still there but didn't quite align.

### Upspire Studios (November 2022-Present)

Shawn formalized his work as "Upspire Studios," a consulting firm offering:

- Web application development
- Strategic planning for emerging technologies
- Generative art production

This allowed him to maintain consulting income while deepening his art practice, avoiding the all-or-nothing trap of earlier ventures.

**Key Philosophy Shift:** Rather than building a 9-year company, he's building a sustainable creative practice with consulting as ballast.

### The Singulars Model (2023-Present)

The culmination of this evolution is the "Singulars" series: one-of-one generative artworks created through a collaborative process with collectors.

**The Process:**

1. Collector shares a fragment: a story, emotion, memory, color, music, or intention
2. Shawn reads the submission and intuitively adjusts algorithmic parameters (seed values, randomness boundaries)
3. He generates dozens of outputs, waiting for a moment of resonance
4. When the piece "clicks"—when collector story, algorithm, and visual form align—it's selected
5. Digital preview is sent; tiered pricing creates a lifecycle ($275 early access, $550 second window, $1,200 public)
6. Physical fabrication: laser cutting and hand assembly

**The Philosophy Behind Singulars:**

This model represents the full arc of Shawn's journey:
- Tech (Xbox, Facebook tools) was about scaling. Singulars is about depth.
- Tech was about optimization. Singulars is about intuition and slowness.
- Tech was about extraction (attention, data, engagement). Singulars is about co-creation and mutual presence.
- Tech was about disruption. Singulars is about care.

## Current Roles & Commitments (2023-2025)

### Board & Advisory Work

**Salish Current (July 2023-Present):** Board member of a local investigative news nonprofit, reflecting ongoing commitment to civic responsibility and community.

**Whatcom Community College Foundation (September 2023-Present):** Board of Directors role, supporting local education.

**Non-GMO Project (August 2022-Present):** Strategic advisor and Information Systems Renewal Officer. This role bridges his tech expertise with regenerative food systems, a growing values interest.

### Consulting & Creative Practice

**Upspire Studios:** Continues consulting work while deepening generative art.

**Shawnkemp.art:** Substack-based distribution of artworks, process documentation, and philosophy.

## Psychological Profile & Values Architecture

### The Conscience Pattern

Shawn exhibits a consistent psychological pattern across decades:

1. **Pioneer/Explorer:** Drawn to frontier tech, early adoption, systems that are new and uncertain
2. **Builder/Achiever:** Capable of building communities, scaling operations, creating value
3. **Conscience/Questioner:** Gradually becomes aware of ethical implications, unintended consequences
4. **Pivot/Retreat:** When values conflict with success, chooses values; leaves to reflect
5. **Integration:** Returns with different focus, integrating what he learned

This is not cynicism or failure; it's integrity with restlessness.

### Core Values (Inferred)

- **Integrity:** Won't stay in something unethical even if it's successful
- **Curiosity:** Self-described as "insatiably curious"; always exploring edges
- **Community:** Roots himself geographically (Bellingham); builds local networks, mentors
- **Craftsmanship:** Values quality, precision, materiality, durability
- **Regeneration:** Increasingly focused on systems that renew rather than extract
- **Intention:** Moves away from scaling/growth toward depth/presence
- **Impact:** Cares deeply about legacy and effects; can't ignore harms
- **Learning:** Each pivot involves explicit reflection and integration

### Bellingham as Anchor

Despite ventures in Seattle and Portland, Bellingham has been Shawn's constant since 1994. He started the industrial design degree there, returned after Microsoft burnout, built ActionSprout with offices in Bellingham, founded Invent Coworking there, and currently bases himself there with his art practice and board roles. Bellingham represents rootedness, community commitment, and intentional living.

## Summary: The Artist as Ethical Pioneer

Shawn Kemp's biography is not a linear success narrative. It's a story of an intelligent, capable builder who repeatedly chooses integrity over scale. He has successfully:

- Led teams at a Fortune 500 (Microsoft)
- Built a company to 150,000 clients in 70+ countries (ActionSprout)
- Created sustainable consulting practices (Beta Think, Upspire)
- Mentored countless entrepreneurs and designers
- Contributed to nonprofit infrastructure (ONE/Northwest/Groundwire)
- Served his local community through boards and civic work

Yet at each major milestone, he has paused, questioned, and often stepped back when ethical misalignment became unbearable. This restraint, this refusal to simply optimize for growth, is increasingly rare and increasingly valuable.

His current work as a generative artist represents a full circle: returning to the maker ethos of his high school solar car project, applying three decades of tech and systems thinking, but doing so in service of joy, singularity, and intention rather than scale and optimization.

**The Working Philosophy:** Create work that brings delight. Build systems (artistic and business) that regenerate rather than extract. Ground yourself in community. Listen to your conscience. Repeat.
