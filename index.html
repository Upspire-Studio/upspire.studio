                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>I'm a serial entrepreneur and innovator who has helped launch dozens of products. From the very first Xbox website to an app that powered tens of thousands of nonprofit Facebook pages with combined weekly reach in the hundreds of millions.</p>
                    <p>I'm a strategist, engineer, designer, marketer, community organizer, and leader. I love data and use research and insights constantly in my work. I surf the tension between functionality and aesthetics with ease.</p>
                    <p>I'm one of those rare individuals who has the skills to do it all. From building a tech stack, to designing the user experience, to understanding the market and financial models. I've been an angel investor in dozens of ventures and helped screen hundreds more.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not helping advise ventures or building web apps, I create <a href="https://shawnkemp.art/">generative art</a> using code that transforms into physical artworks cut from layers of paper with a high-powered laser.</p>
